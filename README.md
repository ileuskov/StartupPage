Hello there! This is a a starting page for the Startup called "Meow Plaza".

I'm a cat person and also like to travel. I always wanted to open up a small hotel just for the pets so they can enjoy a vacation as well.
This is my small contribution to this dream.

The page is made with:
1) HTML, 
2) CSS,
3) Bootstrap,
4) a little bit of jQuery and JS (but not personally coded)

The main feature of this page is a navbar menu that collapses when the screen is small (tablet/iPad) and extra small (smartphone). 
For that feature I had to add two links to the jQuery and JS in the end. Although I didn't use JS or jQuery in this project personally, those links ensure the functionality of the navbar.

It is fully responsive and can be read comfortably from any screen.

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
